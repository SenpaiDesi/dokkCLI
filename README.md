# dokkCLI
DOKKCLI is a Python multi tool application designed for portable and fast deployment.
Covering a large set of tools and automated setup to provide you access anywhere at anytime.


## Installation guide.
Head over to the [release page](https://github.com/SenpaiDesi/dokkCLI/releases) and select the release
Extract the zip and add the folder to your PATH enviroment.
Open up cmd and type cli.py or dokkcli (without .py)  and you should see the program come to live.

## First time installers only:
Some files and folders need to be specifically generated and named.
With this we made a installer (dokkcli-Installer.exe) which will place the files in the correct folder.
Once you run the installer it specifically has the standard folder of c:\ **DO NOT CHANGE THAT**
If you do decide to change that you will have to edit tracker.py and replace the c:\ geo.dat path!

If you use the zip instead:
Please replace the geo.dat file path in tracker.py into the path where you extracted the zip. 
For example: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\dokkcli\programfiles\geo.dat
